## Overview of Weather Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this Weather Analysis is to learn how to call an API and use this information to create maps using the gmaps function. In this weather analysis we called 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes. We then found nearby hotels using parameters with minimum and maximum weather requirements. We used the directions function to map the driving directions between four cities. We formatted the maps to include markers that showed relevent information for each city.
